# Built in Unity Shader
 Substance Painter Shader which emulates the Unity Built-In Metallic/Roughness Shader 

This shader was initally made by Damart3d
Initial glsl shader found here:
https://damart3d.blogspot.com/2017/01/unity-5-shader-for-substance-painter.html

I just updated it where i could so it can run for newer versions of substance painter, full credit to damart3d for the initial work.

Current version is in alpha 0.0.1, there will likely be bugs and things i havent noticed, any issues let me know.

Recommended to install the Unity 5 export preset "Unity 5.spexp"

How to Install:

1: Download the winrar file

2: Import the "Built-in-Unity.glsl" file into your Substance Painter Project

3: Apply shader to viewport via "Shader Settings"

4: From Display settings, Enable "Activate Color Profile" with colorlut "gamma2-2"
